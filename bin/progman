Basically

    % progman PROG

is roughly the same as:

    % man `which PROG`

except that it offers tab completion and can also search PROG in the current
directory or normal path (e.g. `progless ../bin/foo`).

=head1 NAME

progman - Show manpage for program

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.14 of progman (from Perl distribution App-ProgUtils), released on 2014-11-28.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Basic usage:

 % progman mpath

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C progman progman

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete progman 'p/*/`progman`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _progman() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" progman`) }

 compctl -K _progman progman

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
